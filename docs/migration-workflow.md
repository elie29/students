# Database Migration Workflow

This document explains the workflow for managing database schema changes using Entity Framework Core migrations in a production environment with separate repositories for code and migrations.

## Overview

The Student Management application has the following setup:

1. **Main API Repository**: Contains the application code, models, and business logic
2. **Migrations Repository**: Contains the database migration history and scripts

This separation allows for independent management of code and database schema, with proper coordination through CI/CD pipelines.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Making Model Changes

When you need to modify the database schema, first update the model classes in the API project:

```csharp
// Example: Adding a new property to the Student model
public class Student
{
    // Existing properties
    
    [StringLength(20)]
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. Creating a Migration

After updating the model, create a new migration in the migrations project:

```bash
# Navigate to the migrations project
cd migrations/StudentManagement.Migrations

# Create a new migration with a descriptive name
dotnet ef migrations add AddStudentPhoneNumber
```

### 3. Verify Migration Code

Review the generated migration file to ensure it correctly represents your model changes:

```csharp
public partial class AddStudentPhoneNumber : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.AddColumn<string>(
            name: "PhoneNumber",
            table: "Students",
            type: "varchar(20)",
            maxLength: 20,
            nullable: true)
            .Annotation("MySql:CharSet", "utf8mb4");
    }

    protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.DropColumn(
            name: "PhoneNumber",
            table: "Students");
    }
}
```

### 4. Test Migration Locally

Apply the migration to your local development database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 5. Commit Changes

Commit and push changes to both repositories:

```bash
# In API repository
git add .
git commit -m "Add phone number to Student model"
git push

# In migrations repository
git add .
git commit -m "Add migration for student phone number"
git push
```

## Production Deployment

### 1. Azure DevOps Pipeline

The deployment is handled by the Azure DevOps pipeline, which has three main stages:

1. **Database Migration**: Applies pending migrations to the production database
2. **Application Deployment**: Builds and deploys the updated API
3. **Verification**: Ensures the API is running correctly after deployment

### 2. Managing Database Changes

For sensitive database changes, consider the following best practices:

- **Data Loss**: Be careful with migrations that might result in data loss (e.g., dropping columns)
- **Large Tables**: For large tables, consider creating custom migrations to minimize impact
- **Downtime**: Schedule database changes during low-traffic periods

### 3. Rollback Procedures

If you need to rollback a database migration:

```bash
# Rollback to a specific migration
dotnet ef database update PreviousMigrationName --connection "$(ProductionDbConnection)"
```

To rollback the application code:

1. Redeploy the previous version of the API application
2. Ensure the model version matches the database schema

## Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Migration Names**: Use clear, descriptive names for migrations
2. **Small, Incremental Changes**: Prefer small, focused migrations over large ones
3. **Test Migrations Thoroughly**: Test on development/staging before production
4. **Version Coordination**: Ensure API and database versions are compatible
5. **Consider Data Seeding**: Use migrations for reference data or initial data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Failing**: 
   - Check if the database server is accessible
   - Verify connection string
   - Check for SQL syntax errors

2. **Model Snapshot Conflicts**:
   - Ensure the model snapshot is up to date
   - Rebuild the migrations project

3. **Pipeline Failures**:
   - Check the connection string variable in Azure DevOps
   - Verify the Azure service connection
   - Check pipeline logs for specific errors

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with migrations:

1. Check Entity Framework Core documentation
2. Review migration logs in Azure DevOps
3. Contact the database administrator or DevOps team
